Underestimating the constraints and overestimating the capabilities of deep learning may lead to frustratingly poor results, at least until you gain some experience and can solve the problems that arise.

Regardless of whether you are doing a project just for your own learning or for practical application in your organization, you want something where you can get started quickly.

For instance, if your final goal is an application that runs on a mobile phone, then that should be what you have after each iteration. But perhaps in the early iterations you take some shortcuts, for instance by doing all of the processing on a remote server, and using a simple responsive web application.

        "There are many domains in which deep learning has not been used to analyze images yet, but those where it has been tried have nearly universally shown that computers can recognize what items are in an image at least as well as people can—even specially trained people, such as radiologists. This is known as *object recognition*. Deep learning is also good at recognizing where objects in an image are, and can highlight their locations and name each found object. This is known as *object detection* (there is also a variant of this that we saw in <<chapter_intro>>, where every pixel is categorized based on what kind of object it is part of—this is called *segmentation*). Deep learning algorithms are generally not good at recognizing images that are significantly different in structure or style to those used to train the model. For instance, if there were no black-and-white images in the training data, the model may do poorly on black-and-white images. Similarly, if the training data did not contain hand-drawn images, then the model will probably do poorly on hand-drawn images. There is no general way to check what types of images are missing in your training set, but we will show in this chapter some ways to try to recognize when unexpected image types arise in the data when the model is being used in production (this is known as checking for *out-of-domain* data).\n",

        "One major challenge for object detection systems is that image labelling can be slow and expensive. There is a lot of work at the moment going into tools to try to make this labelling faster and easier, and to require fewer handcrafted labels to train accurate object detection models. One approach that is particularly helpful is to synthetically generate variations of input images, such as by rotating them or changing their brightness and contrast; this is called *data augmentation* and also works well for text and other types of models. We will be discussing it in detail in this chapter.\n",

We are not aware of any rigorous work done in this area to compare them to humans, but anecdotally it seems to us that deep learning performance is similar to human performance on these tasks. Deep learning is also very good at generating context-appropriate text, such as replies to social media posts, and imitating a particular author's style. It's good at making this content compelling to humans too—in fact, even more compelling than human-generated text. However, deep learning is currently not good at generating *correct* responses! We don't currently have a reliable way to, for instance, combine a knowledge base of medical information with a deep learning model for generating medically correct natural language responses. This is very dangerous, because it is so easy to create content that appears to a layman to be compelling, but actually is entirely incorrect.\n",

        "Another concern is that context-appropriate, highly compelling responses on social media could be used at massive scale—thousands of times greater than any troll farm previously seen—to spread disinformation, create unrest, and encourage conflict. As a rule of thumb, text generation models will always be technologically a bit ahead of models recognizing automatically generated text. For instance, it is possible to use a model that can recognize artificially generated content to actually improve the generator that creates that content, until the classification model is no longer able to complete its task.\n",

However, the performance is already good enough that many people are using these systems—for instance, Google's online translation system (and every other online service we are aware of) is based on deep learning."

But again, we have the same warning that we discussed in the previous section: there is no guarantee that these captions will actually be correct.\n",

For instance, an automatic system can be used to identify potential stroke victims directly from CT scans, and send a high-priority alert to have those scans looked at quickly. There is only a three-hour window to treat strokes, so this fast feedback loop could save lives. At the same time, however, all scans could continue to be sent to radiologists in the usual way, so there would be no reduction in human input. Other deep learning models could automatically measure items seen on the scans, and insert those measurements into reports, warning the radiologists about findings that they may have missed, and telling them about other cases that might be relevant."

If you already have a system that is using random forests or gradient boosting machines (popular tabular modeling tools that you will learn about soon), then switching to or adding deep learning may not result in any dramatic improvement. Deep learning does greatly increase the variety of columns that you can include—for example, columns containing natural language (book titles, reviews, etc.), and high-cardinality categorical columns (i.e., something that contains a large number of discrete choices, such as zip code or product ID). On the down side, deep learning models generally take longer to train than random forests or gradient boosting machines, although this is changing thanks to libraries such as [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/), which provides GPU acceleration for the whole modeling pipeline.

In particular, they generally have a high-cardinality categorical variable representing users, and another one representing products (or something similar). A company like Amazon represents every purchase that has ever been made by its customers as a giant sparse matrix, with customers as the rows and products as the columns. Once they have the data in this format, data scientists apply some form of collaborative filtering to *fill in the matrix*. For example, if customer A buys products 1 and 10, and customer B buys products 1, 2, 4, and 10, the engine will recommend that A buy 2 and 4. Because deep learning models are good at handling high-cardinality categorical variables, they are quite good at handling recommendation systems. They particularly come into their own, just like for tabular data, when combining these variables with other kinds of data, such as natural language or images. They can also do a good job of combining all of these types of information with additional metadata represented as tables, such as user information, previous transactions, and so forth.\n",

For instance, protein chains look a lot like natural language documents, in that they are long sequences of discrete tokens with complex relationships and meaning throughout the sequence. And indeed, it does turn out that using NLP deep learning methods is the current state-of-the-art approach for many types of protein analysis. As another example, sounds can be represented as spectrograms, which can be treated as images; standard deep learning approaches for images turn out to work really well on spectrograms."

        "Consider a model in an autonomous vehicle: you want to help a car drive safely from point A to point B without human intervention. Great predictive modeling is an important part of the solution, but it doesn't stand on its own; as products become more sophisticated, it disappears into the plumbing. Someone using a self-driving car is completely unaware of the hundreds (if not thousands) of models and the petabytes of data that make it work. But as data scientists build increasingly sophisticated products, they need a systematic design approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use data not just to generate more data (in the form of predictions), but to produce *actionable outcomes*. That is the goal of the Drivetrain Approach. Start by defining a clear *objective*. For instance, Google, when creating their first search engine, considered \"What is the user’s main objective in typing in a search query?\" This led them to their objective, which was to \"show the most relevant search result.\" The next step is to consider what *levers* you can pull (i.e., what actions you can take) to better achieve that objective. In Google's case, that was the ranking of the search results. The third step was to consider what new *data* they would need to produce such a ranking; they realized that the implicit information regarding which pages linked to which other pages could be used for this purpose. Only after these first three steps do we begin thinking about building the predictive *models*. Our objective and available levers, what data we already have and what additional data we will need to collect, determine the models we can build. The models will take both the levers and any uncontrollable variables as their inputs; the outputs from the models can be combined to predict the final state for our objective."

        "Let's consider another example: recommendation systems. The *objective* of a recommendation engine is to drive additional sales by surprising and delighting the customer with recommendations of items they would not have purchased without the recommendation. The *lever* is the ranking of the recommendations. New *data* must be collected to generate recommendations that will *cause new sales*. This will require conducting many randomized experiments in order to collect data about a wide range of recommendations for a wide range of customers. This is a step that few organizations take; but without it, you don't have the information you need to actually optimize recommendations based on your true objective (more sales!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you could build two *models* for purchase probabilities, conditional on seeing or not seeing a recommendation. The difference between these two probabilities is a utility function for a given recommendation to a customer. It will be low in cases where the algorithm recommends a familiar book that the customer has already rejected (both components are small) or a book that they would have bought even without the recommendation (both components are large and cancel each other out).\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, in practice often the practical implementation of your models will require a lot more than just training a model! You'll often need to run experiments to collect more data, and consider how to incorporate your models into the overall system you're developing. Speaking of data, let's now focus on how to find data for your project."

For instance, if we were trying to recognize breeds of dog or cat, we might end up cropping out a key part of the body or the face necessary to distinguish between similar breeds.

        "- As we've seen, GPUs are only useful when they do lots of identical work in parallel. If you're doing (say) image classification, then you'll normally be classifying just one user's image at a time, and there isn't normally enough work to do in a single image to keep a GPU busy for long enough for it to be very efficient. So, a CPU will often be more cost-effective.\n",
        "- An alternative could be to wait for a few users to submit their images, and then batch them up and process them all at once on a GPU. But then you're asking your users to wait, rather than getting answers straight away! And you need a high-volume site for this to be workable. If you do need this functionality, you can use a tool such as Microsoft's [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime), or [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\n",

        "You may well want to deploy your application onto mobile devices, or edge devices such as a Raspberry Pi. There are a lot of libraries and frameworks that allow you to integrate a model directly into a mobile application. However, these approaches tend to require a lot of extra steps and boilerplate, and do not always support all the PyTorch and fastai layers that your model might use. In addition, the work you do will depend on what kind of mobile devices you are targeting for deployment—you might need to do some work to run on iOS devices, different work to run on newer Android devices, different work for older Android devices, etc. Instead, we recommend wherever possible that you deploy the model itself to a server, and have your mobile or edge application connect to it as a web service.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are quite a few upsides to this approach. The initial installation is easier, because you only have to deploy a small GUI application, which connects to the server to do all the heavy lifting. More importantly perhaps, upgrades of that core logic can happen on your server, rather than needing to be distributed to all of your users. Your server will have a lot more memory and processing capacity than most edge devices, and it is far easier to scale those resources if your model becomes more demanding. The hardware that you will have on a server is also going to be more standard and more easily supported by fastai and PyTorch, so you don't have to compile your model into a different form.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are downsides too, of course. Your application will require a network connection, and there will be some latency each time the model is called. (It takes a while for a neural network model to run anyway, so this additional network latency may not make a big difference to your users in practice. In fact, since you can use better hardware on the server, the overall latency may even be less than if it were running locally!) Also, if your application uses sensitive data then your users may be concerned about an approach which sends that data to a remote server, so sometimes privacy considerations will mean that you need to run the model on the edge device (it may be possible to avoid this by having an *on-premise* server, such as inside a company's firewall). Managing the complexity and scaling the server can create additional overhead too, whereas if your model runs on the edge devices then each user is bringing their own compute resources, which leads to easier scaling with an increasing number of users (also known as *horizontal scaling*)."

We offer an iPhone app that depends on computer vision, and for years we ran our own computer vision models in the cloud. This was the only way to do it then since those models needed significant memory and compute resources and took minutes to process inputs. This approach required building not only the models (fun!) but also the infrastructure to ensure a certain number of \"compute worker machines\" were absolutely always running (scary), that more machines would automatically come online if traffic increased, that there was stable storage for large inputs and outputs, that the iOS app could know and tell the user how their job was doing, etc. Nowadays Apple provides APIs for converting models to run efficiently on device and most iOS devices have dedicated ML hardware, so that's the strategy we use for our newer models. It's still not easy but in our case it's worth it, for a faster user experience and to worry less about servers. What works for you will depend, realistically, on the user experience you're trying to create and what you personally find is easy to do. If you really know how to run servers, do it. If you really know how to build native mobile apps, do that. There are many roads up the hill.\n",

In this book, we can't hope to cover all the complexity of managing deployed data products, such as managing multiple versions of models, A/B testing, canarying, refreshing the data (should we just grow and grow our datasets all the time, or should we regularly remove some of the old data?), handling data labeling, monitoring all this, detecting model rot, and so forth. In this section we will give an overview of some of the most important issues to consider; for a more detailed discussion of deployment issues we refer to you to the excellent [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920215912.do) by Emmanuel Ameisen (O'Reilly)\n",

But with a neural network the behavior emerges from the model's attempt to match the training data, rather than being exactly defined.\n",

The good news, however, is that there are ways to mitigate these risks using a carefully thought-out process.

The humans involved in the manual process should look at the deep learning outputs and check whether they make sense. For instance, with our bear classifier a park ranger could have a screen displaying video feeds from all the cameras, with any possible bear sightings simply highlighted in red. The park ranger would still be expected to be just as alert as before the model was deployed; the model is simply helping to check for problems at this point.\n",

        "One of the biggest challenges in rolling out a model is that your model may change the behaviour of the system it is a part of. For instance, consider a \"predictive policing\" algorithm that predicts more crime in certain neighborhoods, causing more police officers to be sent to those neighborhoods, which can result in more crimes being recorded in those neighborhoods, and so on. In the Royal Statistical Society paper [\"To Predict and Serve?\"](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x), Kristian Lum and William Isaac observe that: \"predictive policing is aptly named: it is predicting future policing, not future crime.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Part of the issue in this case is that in the presence of bias (which we'll discuss in depth in the next chapter), *feedback loops* can result in negative implications of that bias getting worse and worse. For instance, there are concerns that this is already happening in the US, where there is significant bias in arrest rates on racial grounds. [According to the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white), \"despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana.\" The impact of this bias, along with the rollout of predictive policing algorithms in many parts of the US, led Bärí Williams to [write in the *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/intelligent-policing-and-my-innocent-children.html): \"The same technology that’s the source of so much excitement in my career is being used in law enforcement in ways that could mean that in the coming years, my son, who is 7 now, is more likely to be profiled or arrested—or worse—for no reason other than his race and where we live.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "A helpful exercise prior to rolling out a significant machine learning system is to consider this question: \"What would happen if it went really, really well?\" In other words, what if the predictive power was extremely high, and its ability to influence behavior was extremely significant? In that case, who would be most impacted? What would the most extreme results potentially look like? How would you know what was really going on?\n",
        "\n",
        "Such a thought exercise might help you to construct a more careful rollout plan, with ongoing monitoring systems and human oversight. Of course, human oversight isn't useful if it isn't listened to, so make sure that there are reliable and resilient communication channels so that the right people will be aware of issues, and will have the power to fix them."

        "One of the things our students have found most helpful to solidify their understanding of this material is to write it down. There is no better test of your understanding of a topic than attempting to teach it to somebody else. This is helpful even if you never show your writing to anybody—but it's even better if you share it! So we recommend that, if you haven't already, you start a blog. Now that you've completed Chapter 2 and have learned how to train and deploy models, you're well placed to write your first blog post about your deep learning journey. What's surprised you? What opportunities do you see for deep learning in your field? What obstacles do you see?\n",
